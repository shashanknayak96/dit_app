# DIT App

A note taking application to help get your tasks done.

## Download

Get the apk file from <a href="https://github.com/shashanknayak96/dit_app/releases" >Release</a>'s section.

## Idea

The basic idea for the application is to be able to plan tasks such that they become easier to manage and complete when required.

The idea is:
1. You plan out tasks you want to/have to do and add them to the application.
2. Once a task has been completed, you mark them checked.
3. Everyday at midnight, all the tasks that were checked will be removed (meaning you no longer have to worry about them)
4. The tasks that weren't checked will be remain in the list and continue to show unless checked.

## Contribution
Feel free to raise a PR for any bugs/fixes you feel can be incorporated to the application.
